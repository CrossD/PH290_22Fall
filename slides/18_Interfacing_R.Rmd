## Interfacing in R

R is able to interface with many other languages (C, C++, Python, Julia, etc)

- Pros for interfacing with C/C++: Speed and memory efficiency, and flexibility

- Cons: Harder to read code, program, debug, and install than pure-R code; bug-prone; potential platform dependency; 

- Use cases: When R code is not fast enough; when there is an external library that you want to use but is written in a low-level language

## Introduction to C++

- C++ is a compiled language. It extends (is a superset of) the C language

- R itself is written in C, so it is natural to use C++ to extend R

- C++ files end with `.cpp`. Code lines end with a semi-colon `;`

- C++ libraries offer header files ending with `.h` for specifying the function signatures they implement. These files will be `#include`'d in other `.h`/`.cpp` files

- The compiler is called `g++` accessible in bash

---

## A first program

hello.cpp:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world \n";
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run in bash:
```
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```

---

- C++ is a strongly typed language -- results are *very much* dependent on the types of objects, even for `1 / 3`

- Variables must have a declared type. E.g., `int i = 0;`

- Function arguments and returned values are also typed

</br> </br>

Data type correspondence between R/Rcpp/C++. Adapted from [here](https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/070_data_types.html)

|Value | R vector|Rcpp vector|Rcpp matrix|C++ scalar|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Logical|`logical`  |`LogicalVector`| `LogicalMatrix`|`bool`|
|Integer|`integer`  |`IntegerVector`|`IntegerMatrix`|`int`|
|Real|`numeric` |`NumericVector`|`NumericMatrix`|`double`|
|String|`character`|`CharacterVector`| `CharacterMatrix`|`string`|

---

## Declaring C++ variables

- C++ is very primitive (not smart). Must declare variables before use. Uninitialized variables contain garbage

- Result of a function (here division or integer division, both `/`) depends on the types of inputs. This behavior is called operator/function overloading

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int i;
    int j = 1;
    int l = 3;
    bool k = true;
    double ld = 3.0;

    std::cout << i << "\n" // garbage
              << j / l << "\n"
              << l / ld << "\n" 
              << k << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

---

## C++ works with the memory directly

- C++ works with the memory directly via pointers, memory allocation, and de-allocation

- Pointers in C++ let you work with references, like working with environments in R

- A pointer is a reference to the memory address. 
    - `int* i` creates a pointer `i` to an integer
    - `&j` obtains the address of `j`, which can then be saved to a pointer (say, `i = &j` if `i` is an integer pointer and `j` is an integer)
    - `*i` (outside of variable declaration) dereferences `i`, namely, take out the integer value pointed to by `i`

---

- C++ is very flexible in what a function can do with objects. E.g., 

    - Call by value: `int f_by_val(int i)` takes input `i` by value (makes copy, no side effects)

    - Call by value: `int f_by_pt(int* i)` takes input pointer `i` by value. This makes it possible for the function to modify the value pointed to by `i` (leaving side-effects)

    - Call by reference: `int f_by_ref(int &i)` takes input `i` by reference. This makes it possible for the function to modify the value `i` directly (leaving side-effects)

---

```
#include <iostream>
int f_by_val(int i) { // declaration goes before use
    i += 1;
    return i;
}
int f_by_pt(int* i) {
    *i += 1;
    return *i;
}
int f_by_ref(int &i) {
    i += 1;
    return i;
}
int main() {
    int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;
    int* bp=&b;

    int a2 = f_by_val(a);
    f_by_pt(bp);
    f_by_ref(c);

    std::cout << a << "\n"
              << a2 << "\n"
              << b << "\n" 
              << c << "\n"
              << bp << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

---

- An array is defined by `int vec[3] = {2, 5, 3}`. 

- *C++ counts from 0*. So `vec[0]` has value 2 and `vec[1]` is 5

- An array is a pointer under the hood, and `vec[1]` is the same as `*(vec + 1)`
    - So when a function takes an array as argument, it is capable of modifying the array in-place

- The previous array declaration only supports a static length (e.g., 3 there)

- C++ uses `new` to allocate memory dynamically (create a vector of unknown length at the compilation time) and `delete` to deallocate

---

```
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double a[3] = {1.5, 3.1, -1.2};
    std::cout << a << "\n"
              << a[0] << "\n"
              << *a << "\n"
              << *(a + 1) << "\n";

    int n;
    cout << "Enter n: \n";
    cin >> n;
    double *arr = new double[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = std::pow((double) i, 3.0);
        cout << arr[i] << '\n';
    }
    delete[] arr;

    return 0;
}
```

## Interfacing R with C/C++

---

## Interfaces available in R

- `.C()` and `.Call()` are two interfaces to call low-level code in R

- The essential difference is:
    - `.C()` manipulates C objects only 
    - `.Call()` works with existing R objects


---

- In bash, issue `R CMD SHLIB mycode.cpp` to compile a shared library to be loaded by R

- `dyn.load(mycode.so)` loads the shared library

- If C++ code is used in a package, `NAMESPACE` should include a line `useDynLib(mycode)`

- You can register a C++ function so R checks the number and types of the arguments

---

## `.C()` interface

- `.C()` let you call low-level code in R

    - Easy to start with since you don't need to deal with the structure of R objects

    - More restrictive

    - Copies are made to protect the validity of R objects
    
    - Your C++ function should not return, but instead store the results by modifying the input arguments which get passed back to R

---

## SIR model using the `.C` interface

`SIR_c.cpp`:
```
extern "C"        // Compile the C++ code into a C-friendly format
void SIR_c(double* dt, double* beta, double* gamma, 
       double* initial, double* res, int* dim) {

  int n = dim[0];
  res[0] = initial[0];
  res[0 + n] = initial[1];     // stride to index the column:
  res[0 + 2 * n] = initial[2]; // R matrix is a long vector

    double a, b;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    a = *beta * res[i - 1] * res[i - 1 + n] * dt[0];
    b = *gamma * res[i - 1 + n] * dt[0];
    res[i] = res[i - 1] - a;
    res[i + n] = res[i - 1 + n] + a - b;
    res[i + 2 * n] = res[i - 1 + 2 * n] + b;
  }
}
```

---

In R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
system("R CMD SHLIB SIR_c.c")
dyn.load("SIR_c.so")

SIR_c_R <- function(duration, dt, beta, gamma, 
                    initial=c(0.999, 0.001, 0)) {
  res <- matrix(0.0, 1 + floor(duration / dt), 3)
  a <- .C("SIR_c", 
          dt      = as.double(dt),
          beta    = as.double(beta),
          gamma   = as.double(gamma),
          initial = as.double(initial),
          res     = res,
          dim     = dim(res))

  a$res
}
```

---

## `.Call()` interface

- `.Call()` is a more flexible calling mechanism

    - The programmer needs to manipulate *references* to R objects

    - Copies are *not* made, so is more efficient. 

    - Can be dangerous if your program does not behave and get killed while running

    - R uses only one single C++ type `SEXP` which encompasses all possible R objects

---

## SIR model using the `.Call` interface

```
#include <Rinternals.h>
#include <R.h>
#include <cmath>

extern "C" 
SEXP SIR_cpp0(SEXP Duration, SEXP Dt, SEXP Beta, SEXP Gamma, SEXP Initial) {

  double *duration = REAL(Duration);
  double *dt = REAL(Dt);
  double *beta = REAL(Beta);
  double *gamma = REAL(Gamma);
  double *initial = REAL(Initial);

  int n = std::floor(*duration / *dt) + 1;
  SEXP myreturn;
  PROTECT(myreturn = allocMatrix(REALSXP, n, 3));
  double* res = REAL(myreturn);
  res[0] = initial[0];
  res[0 + n] = initial[1];
  res[0 + 2 * n] = initial[2];

  double a, b;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {} // ... same as before
  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(myreturn);
}
```

---

- We are allocating an R matrix `myreturn` dynamically. We must protect it from garbage collection using the `PROTECT` macro, and `UNPROTECT` before returning

- In R, 
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    system("R CMD SHLIB SIR_cpp0.cpp")
    dyn.load("SIR_cpp0.so")
    SIR_cpp0_R <- function(duration, dt, beta, gamma, initial=c(0.999, 0.001, 0)) {
      .Call("SIR_cpp0", 
            as.double(duration), 
            as.double(dt), 
            as.double(beta),
            as.double(gamma),
            as.double(initial))
    }
    ```

---
class: inverse

## Your turn

- Compile the two implementations in C++ and run them in R
    - Save the C++ code into a `.cpp` script
    - In R: `system("R CMD SHLIB xxx.cpp")`
    - `dyn.load("...")`
    - Write driver functions in R
    - Run the driver functions

- In either implementation, modify an input in-place in C++, and see whether the input variable in R is changed

---

## Registering compiled code

- Though `.C()` and `.Call()` interfaces are very flexible, they rely on the programmer to specify the quantity and order of arguments correctly, and thus are error prone

- Errors in passing arguments to C can easily cause addressing errors and will crash R

- The registration mechanism can catch some of these errors. You can register the number and types of the input arguments

- Registration is available when used within a package. 

---

An example registration code from [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Registering-native-routines)

Put this in, e.g., `init.cpp`
```
#include <Rinternals.h>
extern "C" {
// Consider a C routine
void myC(double *x, int *n, char **names, int *status);

// We would register it as
static R_NativePrimitiveArgType myC_type[] = {
    REALSXP, INTSXP, STRSXP, LGLSXP
};

static const R_CMethodDef cMethods[] = {
   {"myC", (DL_FUNC) &myC, 4, myC_type},
   {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}
};

void
R_init_myLib(DllInfo *info)
{
   R_registerRoutines(info, cMethods, NULL, NULL, NULL);
}
}
```

---

## Rcpp

- `library(Rcpp)` is a hugely popular R package which automatizes the process wrapping C++ code for R to be called using the `.Call()` interface

- `Rcpp::cppFunction(code)` makes available a C++ function as an R function  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    Rcpp::cppFunction("
    int whichExceeds(NumericVector x, double thresh) {
        for (int i = 0; i < x.length(); i++) {
            if (x[i] > thresh) {
                return(i + 1); // R index
            } 
        }
        return(0); // If not found
    }
    ")
    whichExceeds(c(1, 5, 2), 4)
    ```


---

Another example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
src <- "
NumericVector movingAverage(NumericVector x, IntegerVector lag) {
  int ll = lag[0], start, stop, n = x.length();
  NumericVector y = NumericVector(n, 0.0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    start = std::max(i - ll, 0);
    stop = std::min(i + ll, n);
    for (int l = start; l <= stop; l++) {
      y[i] += x[l];
    }
    y[i] /= (double) (stop - start + 1);
  } 
  return y;
}"
Rcpp::cppFunction(src)
movingAverage(c(6, 1, 2, 2.5), 1)
```

---

- Data types in R are mapped to Rcpp data types in C++:

| Value   | R vector    | Rcpp vector       | Rcpp matrix       | C++ scalar |
| :---:   | :---:       | :---:             | :---:             | :---:      |
| Logical | `logical`   | `LogicalVector`   | `LogicalMatrix`   | `bool`     |
| Integer | `integer`   | `IntegerVector`   | `IntegerMatrix`   | `int`      |
| Real    | `numeric`   | `NumericVector`   | `NumericMatrix`   | `double`   |
| String  | `character` | `CharacterVector` | `CharacterMatrix` | `string`   |
| List    | `list`      | `List`            |                   |            |


- [Rcpp quick reference](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/Rcpp-quickref.pdf) includes some quick examples

---
class: inverse

## Your turn

Using Rcpp, write a C++ function to find the first entry of a vector that falls outside of [-3, 3]

1. Write the C++ code into an R string 
```
code <- "IntegerVector findFirst(NumericVector x) {
    ...
}"
```

1. Create an R function using `Rcpp::sourceCpp(code)`

1. Test out your code

---

## Convenient C++ functions offered by Rcpp

- `Rcpp::Rcout << "hello world"` prints out info in R

- Vectorized operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for Rcpp vectors and matrices

- R-like functions for
    - random numbers `[dpqr]norm` etc
    - vectorized math functions `abs`, `sin`, etc
    - aggregators `sum/cumsum/var/sd`

- See Ch 8 of the Rcpp book for a complete list

---
## Linear algebra 

- Rcpp itself does not offer matrix computation functions, but its extensions do

- `library(RcppEigen)` builds upon [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), a C++ template library for linear algebra

- `library(RcppArmadillo)` builds upon [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net); similar to Eigen but with a different set of features

- Both offer numerical linear algebra functions

- Implement template programming, so matrix operations are highly optimized

```
cppFunction(depends = "RcppArmadillo", "
arma::vec invDiag(arma::vec v) {
  return arma::diagvec(arma::inv(arma::diagmat(v)));
}")
v <- rnorm(1e3)
bench::mark(invDiag(v))
```

---

## `Makevars`

- `Makevars` is a file to control the compiler options

- `~/.R/Makevars` contains a global version. If you are in an R package, `src/Makevars` takes precedence over the global version

- An example `Makevars`:
```
CC = clang -arch arm64    # C compiler
CXX = clang++ -arch arm64 # C++ compiler
CFLAGS = -Wall -O0 -g     # C complier flags
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -O0 -g   # C++ complier flags
```
    - `-arch arm64` makes the compiled code work on my apple-silicon laptop
    - `-O0`, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`: level of compiler optimization, from zero to most optimization
    - `-g` enables debuggers to debug the code
    - `-Wall` shows all warnings

---

## Debugging C++ code

Debug C/C++ code using lldb and gdb:
- Make sure your compiler flags are set to `-O0` and `-g`
- `R -d lldb` to start R with lldb. If you are on WSL, replace `lldb` by `gdb`
- `r` to run R
- `<Ctrl-C>` to go back to lldb
- `b SIR_c` to set a breakpoint in `SIR_c()` (C++ code)
- `c` to continue to R
- run buggy code in R, and you will be broken at the breakpoint (you are back in lldb)
- lldb commands: `n`, step over
- `s`, step into
- `c`, continue execution until the next breakpoint
- `fr v` shows all variables
- `p res[2]` prints the 3rd entry in res

Here is a debugger [cheatsheet](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html#id4)

---

## Using Rcpp in a package

- Issue `usethis::use_rcpp()` to add boilerplate code for Rcpp (your working directory should be within a package)

- C++ source code should be put in `src/`

- `Rcpp::sourceCpp("file.cpp")` sources a single Rcpp file. Make sure to include necessary header files at the beginning of the cpp files, e.g., `#include <Rcpp.h>`

- In a cpp file, `// [[Rcpp::export]]` wraps a C++ function as an R function

- Roxygen comments are parsed in C++ files as well E.g.,
    ```{r,eval=FALSE}
    //' Multiply x by 2
    //' ...
    //' @export
    // [[Rcpp::export]]
    NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {
      return x * 2;
    }
    ```
