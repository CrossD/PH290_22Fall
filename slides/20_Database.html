## What is a database

- A *database* is a large collection of interrelated data tables

- E.g., electronic medical record database [MIMIC](mimic.physionet.org/) includes the following tables (and much more; download the demo dataset [here](demoData.zip))

![:scale 40%](images/patient.png) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
![:scale 49%](images/admission.png)
![:scale 50%](images/diagnosis.png) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
![:scale 45%](images/icd9.png)



---

## Why are the existing solutions not enough

- R cannot handle data with size larger than the memory (order of GBs). Data in the memory must be saved to the hard disk so it persists

- An ordinary file on the hard disk, like a csv file, does not support efficient searches (linear but not log-time lookup)

---

## What a database offers

- Efficiency
    - Records are updated and accessed quickly
    - Data have minimal redundancy

- Concurrency
    - A database can be accessed/updated concurrently by many users

- Consistency
    - A record is either updated or not updated, not anywhere in between (atomic)
    - The system will always be in a consistent state even if failure occurs (consistency)

- Security
    - Data are saved on hard disk, so records persists even if the system crashes (durability)
    - Access management: Read/write and more granular accesses

---

## Schemas and instances

- A database *schema* is the metadata for a table describing how it is organized. It contains the *name* of the table, *fields* (columns) and the *data types* 

  - E.g., Diagnosis(sub\_id: int, adm\_id: int, seq\_num: int, icd9\_code: string)

- An *instance* of a schema is a specific collection of rows and columns at a given time

---

## Relational vs non-relational database

- A *relational database* mainly arrange data in tables with rows and columns.
    - Offers rich features for queries and table joins
    - Data must fit on hard disks (Terabytes of data)
    - E.g. of implementations: SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL
    - We focus on relational database in this class

- A *non-relational (noSQL) database* 
    - For storing data and simple lookup queires
    - Scales better to large data than relational database

---

## Database use cases and perspectives

- Statistical analyst: Use database to load a large amount of data that doesn't fit into memory, and preprocess (extract/combine/aggregate) a smaller dataset that fits in the memory

- Application programmer: Use a database to keep track of data (e.g., write a shiny app to collect survey response) or expose a subset of database functions to the users (visualize a certain group of patients)

- Database administrator: Access control and reduce redundancy

---

## Reducing redundancy

- Goals:
    - Preserve information (lossless join)
    - Save space
    - Easy maintanence (update/delete single records)

- E.g. of a redundant table:
![:scale 100%](images/joined.png)

---

- A table is said to be in *Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)* if it is non-redundant in the following sense:
    - if a set of columns determines another column, then the former must be an ID for the entire row (is a superkey)

- Eg of tables in BCNF

![:scale 49%](images/admission.png)
![:scale 50%](images/diagnosis.png)

![:scale 45%](images/icd9.png)

---

## Database

A database is often made up of tables representing *entities* and *relations*:

- An *entity* table represents a real-world object. E.g., patients, and the ICD9 descriptions

- A *relationship* table represents the *association* between two or more entities. E.g., admissions, diagnosis

class: big, middle

## SQL

---

## Using a database

Most relational databases follow a client-server architecture:

![:scale 100%](images/serverClient.png)

---

## Using database within R

- We will use the `library(DBI)` to interface R with database backends

- `library(RSQLite)` offers a SQLite backend (which runs within the R process and is serverless)

- Create a database on the hard disk:

```r
library(RSQLite)
db &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "mimicDemo.sqlite")
```

- `dbDisconnect(db)` disconnects a database

- Data for demo is [available here](demoData.zip)

---

## Creating and deleting a table

```
q &lt;- "CREATE TABLE admissionsMini
(
  SUBJECT_ID INT,
  HADM_ID INT,
  ETHNICITY VARCHAR(200),
  INSURANCE VARCHAR(200),
  DIAGNOSIS VARCHAR(200),
  PRIMARY KEY (HADM_ID)
);"
dbExecute(db, q)
```

- Column types must be specified for efficiency of storage

- `VARCHAR(200)` means a string with variable length that is up to 200 characters long

- `dbListTables(db)` shows all available tables in database `db`

- Delete table:

```
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tablename;
```

---

## Key constraints

- Primary key is a constraint that indicates a set of columns must be unique and not null

- Database management systems  (DBMS) often create indices on primary keys, making lookups based on these keys more efficient

---

## Insert into the table

- Insert by specifying the record details
```
INSERT INTO tablename 
VALUES (val1, val2, ..., valp);
```

    E.g.,
    ```
    q &lt;- "INSERT INTO admissionsMini 
      VALUES 
      (99999, 22222, '11/06/22 00:02', 'SEPSIS')
      (9999, 11111, '11/06/22 00:01', 'SEPSIS');"
    dbExecute(db, q)
    ```


- Insert from a CSV:
    
    ```r
    dat &lt;- readr::read_csv('demoData/ADMISSIONSmini.csv')
    dbWriteTable(db, "admissionsMini", dat, append=TRUE)
    ```

---

## Summary of last time 


```r
library(RSQLite)
db &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "mimicDemo.sqlite")
q &lt;- "
CREATE TABLE admissionsMini
(
  SUBJECT_ID INT,
  HADM_ID INT,
  ETHNICITY VARCHAR(200),
  INSURANCE VARCHAR(255),
  DIAGNOSIS VARCHAR(255),
  PRIMARY KEY (HADM_ID)
);
"
  
dbExecute(db, q)
dat &lt;- readr::read_csv('demoData/ADMISSIONSmini.csv')
dbWriteTable(db, "admissionsMini", dat, append=TRUE)

a &lt;- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM admissionsMini")
```

---

## SQL

- Strctured Query Language (SQL) is a query language, i.e., a language to specify what data operation do you want to perform on the database

- SQL is understood by most if not all database implementations, e.g., PostgreSQL and BigQuery

- R's `library(dplyr)` is designed to be very similar to SQL, so you already know a lot about the framework up to difference in syntax

    - There are ways to generate SQL code from R code (`library(dbplyr)`), but we will emphasize writing SQL code ourselves because this works on any systems

---


```r
SELECT [DISTINCT] col1, col2, ..., coln
FROM tab1, tab2, ..., tabm
WHERE conditions;
```

- `SELECT` takes out columns (like `dplyr::select()`)

    - If the `DISTINCT` keyword is specified, then only return distinct rows (like `dplyr::distinct()`)

- `FROM` specifies the tables to select from 
    - A join will be performed if given more than one table. More later

- `WHERE` specifies the selection condition. Only records fulfilling the condition will be returned (like `dplyr::filter()`)

---

- `SELECT *` means extract all columns

- Rename a column/table using `AS`

- Within `WHERE`:
    - Equality test is `=`
    - Conditions can be combined using `AND` or `OR`
    - `LIKE` for string comparisons: `string LIKE pattern` is true (1) if the former matches the pattern
        - `%` means any sequence of length 0 or more, so `%abc%` matches any string containing `abc` 
        - `_` means any single character

---


```r
SELECT ...
ORDER BY col1, col2
LIMIT n1
OFFSET n0;
```

- `ORDER BY` specifies how the returned records should be ordered (like `dplyr::arrange()`)
    - Caution: the order of the returned rows are *not guaranteed* to be same run-by-run, unless `ORDER BY` is specified. So use `ORDER BY` everytime you want to make sure the results are the exactly same

- `LIMIT n1` returns only the first `n1` records. `OFFSET n0` skips the first `n0` records before returning records

---
class: inverse

## Your turn

- Make sure to load the data into a SQLite database following the code from last time 

- Show the initial diagnosis of the 6th to the 10th admissions of hispanic patients. The order is according to the admission ID.

---

## Aggregators and grouping


```r
SELECT COUNT(col1), AVG(col2)
FROM table1
GROUP BY col3
HAVING COUNT(col1) &gt;= 2;
```

- The following aggregators are available: `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`. They are like `dplyr::summarize(mean(x))`

- They are often used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause

- `HAVING` is for post-filtering the results and selecting rows according to the aggregated output

- The biggest difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` is that 
    - `WHERE` constraints the *input* *rows* before aggregators are applied
    - `HAVING` constraints the *output* *rows* after aggregators are applied

- Aggregators can be used within `SELECT` and `HAVING` but not `WHERE`

---

## Combining tables: Set operations

Operations below operates on tables "vertically", namely you get more or less rows but the same number of columns.

- `query1 UNION query2` gives a table that is the union of the two given. Duplicated records will be removed. `UNION` is the same as `UNION DISTINCT`

- `query1 UNION ALL query2` gives the union but retaining duplicated records

- `query1 INTERSECT [ALL|DISTINCT] query2` gives a table containing records in both `query1` and `query2`

- `query1 EXCEPT [ALL|DISTINCT] query2` gives a table containing records in only `query1` but not `query2`

---

## Combining tables: Joins

The table joins expand tables both "horizontally". The number of columns will increase, and the number of rows may increase or decrease depending on the type of join.


```r
...
FROM tab1 [NATURAL|LEFT|RIGHT|FULL] JOIN tab2
ON tab1.key = tab2.key
...
```

Cartesian product:
- `FROM tab1 JOIN tab2` gives the Cartesian product, namely all combinations of rows from tab1 and tab2. Same as `FROM tab1, tab2`

Inner joins:
- `tab1 JOIN tab2 on tab1.key = tab2.key` joins the rows only if the key column matches. Only rows matching the `ON` condition will be retained. The `ON` condition can be complex (connected using `AND` or `OR`) and does not have to be an equality condition
&lt;!-- - `tab1 NATURAL JOIN tab2` assumes the join keys are given by the common columns in the two tables --&gt;

---

Outer joins:
- `tab1 LEFT JOIN tab2 ON tab1.key = tab2.key` is like an inner join except that it retains all rows in the *left table* even if they cannot be joined (in which case the right fields will be filled with NULLs.
- `tab1 FULL JOIN tab2 ON tab1.key = tab2.key` is like a left join except that it retains all rows in *both tables* even if they cannot be joined

- Alternative specification of join keys: `USING (col1, col2)` specifies the join should uses `col1` and `col2` as the join key

Anti join:
- `tab1 LEFT JOIN tab2 ON tab1.key = tab2.key WHERE tab2.key IS NULL` gives rows in the left table that cannot be joined with the right table

---

A table used for demo:

```r
qs &lt;- c(
"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS diagnosisMini;",
" CREATE TABLE diagnosisMini 
(
  SUBJECT_ID INT,
  HADM_ID INT,
  SEQ_NUM INT,
  ICD9_CODE VARCHAR(10)
 );", 
"INSERT INTO diagnosisMini
VALUES
(10006, 142345, 1, '99591'),
(10006, 142345, 2, '99662'),
(10007, 195315, 1, '99591'),
(10007, 195315, 2, '40391'),
(10042, 148562, 1, '99591')
;")
cat(qs)
lapply(qs, dbExecute, conn=db)
```

---
class: inverse

## Your turn

- Use `query1 EXCEPT query2` to find the following: Find the patient IDs for those who have been initially admitted because of sepsis who are not white

- Find the ICD9 diagnosis code for those who are initially admitted because of sepsis. Retain the admission information even if the ICD9 code cannot be found

---

## Complex queries: Nested queries

- Subqueries can be used within a query to form a *nested query*

- Subqueries can be used anywhere where an expression is expected (within `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc)

- E.g., show the admission information for those who have more than one diagnosis: 
    
    ```r
    dbGetQuery(db,
    "SELECT * FROM admissionsMini
    WHERE HADM_ID IN (SELECT HADM_ID FROM diagnosisMini 
                      GROUP BY HADM_ID
                      HAVING count(*) &gt; 1);")
    ```

---

- The subquery may depend on rows/variables from the outer query (like a nested for loop)

- E.g., use only the `admissionsMini` table, and find the admission info for subjects who share the same initial diagnosis with someone else
    
    ```r
    dbGetQuery(db,
    "SELECT * FROM admissionsMini as A
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT DIAGNOSIS FROM admissionsMini 
                  WHERE SUBJECT_ID != A.SUBJECT_ID AND 
                        DIAGNOSIS = A.DIAGNOSIS)")
    ```

- Summary: The `IN` AND `EXISTS` operations are often useful in combination with subqueries

    - `WHERE col1 IN (aColumnFromSubquery)` is true if `col1` is a member of `aColumnFromSubquery`
    - `WHERE EXISTS (aColumnFromSubquery)` is true if `aColumnFromSubquery` is not empty
    - Negated versions are `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS`

---

## Creating intermediate tables

There are a few approaches to create a table-like object for intermediate use (e.g., for breaking down a large query):

- `CREATE TABLE` writes a new table on the hard disk

- `CREATE TEMPORARAY TABLE` is similar to `CREATE TABLE`, except that the temporary table will be removed after your SQL session ends. The temporary table exists on the hard disk

- `CREATE VIEW` is similar to `CREATE TABLE` and persists after the session ends 
    - However, results for the view will be recalculated every time it is used

- `WITH tab AS (subquery) SELECT ... FROM tab` creates an auxilliary statement that works like a table that can be used in the subsequent query
    - This approach *does not require write access* to the database, while the other approaches do

---

- E.g., join two tables created using `WITH`
    
    ```r
    q &lt;- "WITH tab1 AS (SELECT * 
      FROM ad AS A INNER JOIN diagnosisMini AS B 
      ON A.HADM_ID = B.HADM_ID AND A.SUBJECT_ID = B.SUBJECT_ID), 
      tab2 AS (SELECT * FROM diagnosisMini LIMIT 1)
    SELECT * 
    FROM tab1 JOIN tab2
    USING (HADM_ID, SUBJECT_ID);"
    dbGetQuery(db, q)
    ```


---

## Advanced: Window functions

- Some queries are awkward when written using just the techniques covered before. Think about how to show (arbitrary) 2 records for each ethnicity group in `admissionsMini` (`GROUP BY` and `LIMIT 2` won't work)
    
    ```r
    dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM admissionsMini AS A
            WHERE HADM_ID IN (SELECT HADM_ID FROM admissionsMini
                              WHERE ETHNICITY = A.ETHNICITY
                              LIMIT 2)")
    ```
- A *window function* performs calculation over a range of rows related to the current one
    - Window functions returns one result per row, like `dplyr::mutate()` but more general
- It is great for computing something that depends on the order of data, e.g., 
    - a moving average 
    - tell whether an admission has the same diagnosis as the last admission
    - ranks

---

## E.g.

- Select any 2 records per ethnic group (focus on the subquery)
    
    ```r
    dbGetQuery(db, 
      "SELECT * 
      FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() 
            OVER (PARTITION BY ETHNICITY) as rn, *
            FROM admTmp)
      where rn &lt;= 2;")
    ```

- Select top 2 records per ethnic group ordered by a column
    
    ```r
    dbGetQuery(db, 
      "SELECT * 
      FROM (SELECT RANK() 
            OVER (PARTITION BY ETHNICITY ORDER BY HADM_ID) as rk, *
            FROM admTmp)
      where rk &lt;= 2;")
    ```

---

- Cumulative sum
    
    ```r
    dbGetQuery(db, 
    "SELECT SUM(X) OVER (
        ORDER BY HADM_ID
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as CUMSUM, *
    FROM admTmp;")
    ```

---

- Moving average (window is defined according to neighboring rows)
    
    ```r
    a &lt;- dbGetQuery(db, 
    "SELECT AVG(X) OVER (
        ORDER BY HADM_ID
        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
    ) as MA, *
    FROM admTmp;")
    ```

- Average over close-by neighbors (window is defined according to neighboring values)
    
    ```r
    a &lt;- dbGetQuery(db, 
    "SELECT AVG(X) OVER (
        ORDER BY HADM_ID
        RANGE BETWEEN 1000 PRECEDING AND 1000 FOLLOWING
    ) as MA, *
    FROM admTmp;")
    ```

---
class: inverse

## Your turn

- Find the cumulative sum of `SUBJECT_ID` column where the order is defined by `HADM_ID`. Find the cumulative sum for each ethinic group

---

- Summary of window function: 
    
    ```r
    SELECT WINDOW_FUNC(col1) OVER (
        PARTITION BY col2
        ORDER BY col3
        [ROWS BETWEEN quantifier1 AND quantifier2 |
         RANGE BETWEEN val1 AND val2]
    )
    FROM ...;
    ```
- Commonly used and supported window functions: most aggregator functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, etc), `FIRST_VALUE`, `NTH_VALUE`, `LEAD`, `LAG`
- `OVER`: Specify the window for the window function
    - `PARTITION BY`: Like group by. Limit the window to be within each group
    - `ORDER BY`: Like order by, but here gives the order that should be used within each window
    - `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Use rows in the window that is up to the current row (inclusive)
    - `ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING`: Constraint rows in the window that is up to the current row 
    - `RANGE BETWEEN 1000 PRECEDING AND 1000 FOLLOWING`: Constraint rows according to the values of a column

---

- Can save window name using, e.g., 

```r
SELECT AVG(X1) OVER w1, SUM(X1) OVER w1
FROM ...
WINDOW w1 AS (PARTITION BY col2)
```

## Accessing a practical database

---

## MIMIC 3

- I made available the full MIMIC 3 database through Google BigQuery for you to practice (and for HW). These data are slightly perturbed off the original version

- This is the size of the largest table:
.center[
![:scale 40%](images/mimic3size.png)
]

---

## Accessing data

- Access data [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=mimic-3-ph-290&amp;ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1smimic-3-ph-290!2smimic3_mod)

- Your *UC Berkeley accounts* are given access to this project. Make sure to you are accessing the project using the correct account

- You can find a quick overview about the database [here](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/). There are many tables, and you can also find the table descriptions in the link

- You can run some quick query into the database in the browser:
    - Click open a table within the Explorer column
    - Click query

---

## Linking R to BigQuery

- Install the `bigrquery` R library
    
    ```r
    library(bigrquery)
    library(DBI)
    
    db &lt;- dbConnect(
      bigrquery::bigquery(),
      project = "mimic-3-ph-290",
      dataset = "mimic3_mod",
      billing = "mimic-3-ph-290"
      )
    dbListTables(db)
    ```

- You will need to authenticate in the browser the first time you query the database
    - Make sure to use your UC Berkeley account, and 
    - *Select all permissions* before you click confirm

- If you are successful, `dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT count(*) FROM chartevents;")` should give you 330,712,483

---

## Running a query

- E.g., what are the most frequent chart data items recorded in the database?
    
    ```r
    topItems &lt;- dbGetQuery(db, 
      "SELECT DISTINCT ITEMID, COUNT(*) as COUNT 
      FROM chartevents JOIN d_items
      USING (ITEMID)
      GROUP BY ITEMID
      ORDER BY COUNT DESC
      LIMIT 50;")
    ```

- Above shows a small query for which the results fits in the memory. Given a large query, you need to use `dbSendQuery()` and `dbFetch(n=)` to retrieve and process results in batches

- More in HW6

---
class: inverse

## Your turn

- Run a query in the browser against any table

- Connect R to BigQuery and run a query within R

---

class: big, middle

## Indexing

---

## Row- and column-oriented databases

- A *row-oriented* database stores each row (record) in consecutive storage blocks. This makes it faster to access all fields within a record, e.g., for making a prediction for a record based on all features. 
    - "Traditional" databases (Postgres, MySQL, CloudSQL) are mostly row-oriented

- A *column-oriented* database stores each column (variable) in consecutive storage blocks. This makes it faster to aggregate columns (e.g., calculating moving average) because it does not read in necessary columns
    - Cloud databases (BigQuery, RedShift) tend to be column-oriented

---

## Indexing

- We focus on indexing for *row-oriented* (traditional) databases

- Building an index on a column makes it faster to search according to that column
    - Like book contents and subject index

- Considerations for building a good index
    - Search time
    - Insertion time
    - Deletion time
    - Space overhead

- Two types of indices:
    - Hash index
    - B-tree index

---

## Hash index

- Hash index is basically a hash table. Given a key, the value field given by a hash index is the location (on hard disk) of the record 

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/hash_index.png)&lt;/br&gt;
By Jorge Stolfi from wikipedia 
]

---

- The properties of a hash index is the same as hash table. It supports `\(O(1)\)` time search for a specific value (`col = val`), insertion, and deletion. It does not support range search well

- Good for fields that does not have an ordering. E.g., diagnosis or ID

---

## B+ tree index

- B+ tree index relies on a tree-data structure to support fast range queries

- Search (`col = val` or `col &lt; val` etc), insertion, and deletion are all `\(O(\log(n))\)`

---

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/bplustree.png)&lt;/br&gt;
Fig 11.9 from Database System Concepts
]

---

## Creating an index in SQL

- E.g., in PostgreSQL, to create a B+ tree index for record date in `chartevents`: 

```r
CREATE INDEX i_date ON chartevents
USING BTREE (CHARTTIME);
```
