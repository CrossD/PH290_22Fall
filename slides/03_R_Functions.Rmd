## Outline

- R functions

- Writing a function
    
    - Components
    
    - Function factories

---

## Functional programming

- *functional programming* is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and combining functions
    - R is, by and large, a functional programming language

- This contrasts with the *procedural programming* paradigm, where one specifies the series of computational steps to be carried out

- In R, functions are first-class citizens, namely functions behave just like ordinary variables

```{r}
f <- mean
f(1:5)
```

---

- Most R functions are *pure functions*. A function is pure if it satisfies
    1. the same inputs will produce identical outputs (no local states)
    1. the function does not have side-effects
        - no printing, displaying, or writing to the disk
        - no modification of the inputs in-place

- So most R functions call by value, but not by reference

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  x <- 0
  x
}
x <- 1
tmp <- f(x)
x
```

## R functions

- Literally, all computation in R is achieved via function calls

- `library(lobstr)` let us inspect R objects, and here for visualizing abstract syntatic trees

```{r}
library(lobstr)
ast(1 + 2 * 3)
```

---

## R operators

- Operators are functions
    - binary operators `+`, `%*%`, `%in%`, etc are functions of two variables. Also called infix functions
    - special operators: `$`, `[`, `[[`, etc are also functions
    
- Surround a weird function/variable name with backquotes to access it

]

```{r}
`+`
```

---

## Binary operators

- User-defined binary operator must have name surrounded by `%`
```{r}
`%rep%` <- function(a, times) rep(a, times)
"ha" %rep% 3
```


---

## Replacement function

- Replacements can be performed by replacement functions.
    - E.g., `` `class<-` ``

- A replacement function takes two arguments and returns an object
```{r}
`ID<-` <- function(x, value) {
  attr(x, "Patient ID") <-  value
  x
}
a <- "John Smith"
ID(a) <- 123
a
```

---

## Types of functions

There are three internal types of functions in R

- closure, most of the functions you see
    ```{r}
    typeof(`seq`)
    ```

- builtin, R internal functions that call by value. E.g., `+`, `%*%`
    ```{r}
    typeof(`+`)
    ```

- special, R internal functions that do not call by value. Often are language elements. E.g., `$`, `for`
    ```{r}
    typeof(`$`)
    ```

---
class: inverse

## Your Turn

<!-- - What does the operator `%in%` do? Look up the help documentation. If you are stuck in the R console, press <Ctrl-C> -->

- Use `lobstr::ast` to inspect the function calls when you evaluate
    
    ```
    for (i in 1:10) {
        print(i)
    }
    ```

- Create an operator `%+%` to connect strings, so that  `"Hello" %+% "World"` gives `"HelloWorld"`

- Writing functions make your code more manageable

  - Modularizes code
  
  - *Reusable*, so this avoid repetitive coding
  
  - More maintainable. As the requirements evolve, you only need to modify code in one place

      - **Don't repeat yourself (DRY)**

## Components of a function

```
> sd
function (x, na.rm = FALSE) 
sqrt(var(if (is.vector(x) || is.factor(x)) x else as.double(x), 
    na.rm = na.rm))
<environment: namespace:stats>
```

A function consists of three components:

- Formal arguments `formals()`, the argument names and default values. Controls how the function is called

- Function body `body()`, the code inside the function definition

- Environment `environment()`, which controls how the function finds "global" variables and other functions. More later

---

## Argument matching

R matches arguments in the following order. Unmatched arguments in one step will be attempted in subsequent steps

1. exact match by name
1. partial match by name
1. by position. Then if there is a `...` argument, it will take up all remaining arguments

If any arguments remain unmatched, R raises an error. 

The following calls are equivalent 

```
seq(1, 3, length.out=5)
seq(to=3, length=5, 1)
```

---

## dot-dot-dot

- `...` is useful for allowing an arbitrary and varying number of input arguments. E.g.,
    - `sum(..., na.rm = FALSE)`
    - passing along arguments for plotting:
        ```{r, eval=FALSE}
        myplot <- function(x, ...) {
          hist(x, ...)
          boxplot(x, ...)
        }
        myplot(cars$speed, main="car speed", col="red")
        ```

---

- To program with arguments matched by `...`, 
    - `..1`, `..2`, `...length()`, and `...names()` are available
    - `list(...)` converts the arguments
    
```{r}
f <- function(...) {
  print(..1)
  print(...length())
  print(...names())
  list(...)
}
res <- f("B", "P", x="H")
res
```
    
---

## Returning values

- `return(x)` explicitly returns `x` and print
    
    - Can return anywhere in the function body. The code that follows will not be executed
    
```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  if (x >= 1) {
    return(x)
  }
  stop("error here")
}
f(1)
```

---

- `invisible(x)` returns `x` but do not print. Useful for plotting/displaying info
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    # not real code
    plotMyObj <- function(x, ...) {
      dat <- getDataFrame()
      plot(dat, ...)
      invisible(dat)
    }
    ```
    
---

## Resetting/cleanup

- `on.exit(expr)` will enforce the function to execute `expr` when it exits (returns or errs). Useful for setting graphical parameters and deleting temporary files

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plotAndReset <- function(x) {
  oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
  on.exit(par(oldpar))
  
  par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
  hist(x)
  plot(x)
}
```

---

## Functions as input or output

There is nothing preventing you from having a function as either the input or the output.

- Functions can take a function as input. E.g., `lapply`, `optimize`, `ggplot2::ggsave`

- *Function factories* are functions that returns a function as output: `ecdf`, `approxfun`, `ggplot2:::plot_dev`

- These two types of functions are often used together

---

## Writing a function factory

The following is an example for finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $\lambda$ using a function factory and `optimise`. 

Suppose that $X_1,\dots, X_n \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$. 

We will write a function factory to obtain the log-likelihood given $\{X_1,\dots,X_n\}$:

```{r}
getloglik <- function(X) {
  function(lam) {
    sum(dpois(X, lam, log=TRUE))
  }
}
```
---

Suppose the dataset is given by `pscl::prussian$y`, containing yearly counts of Prussian solders kicked dead by army hourses. 

Manufacture the log-likelihood for this dataset:

```{r}
loglik <- getloglik(pscl::prussian$y)
```

Test it out:
```{r}
loglik(0.5)
```

Maximize the likelihood using `optimize`:
```{r}
res <- optimize(loglik, c(0, 100), maximum=TRUE)
```

- loglik is a function with data embedded ("closure")

---

class: inverse

## Your Turn

- Create a function factory that takes inputs $a$ and $b$. The manufactured function gives values of the quadratic function $g(x) = a x^2 + b x$.

- Manufacture a function using $a=1$ and $b = -2$. Then find the minimum value of the function using `optimize`
