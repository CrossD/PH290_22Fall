## Why to write an R package?

- R package is a great way to share R code
    - via CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub, and more

- Even if you are the only user of your code, it is a great way to organize code

    - An R package provides a useful structure to bundle the source code, test files, manuals, etc
    - Formalize many aspects of your code, like dependency, versioning, and license
    - R offers checks for potential issues in packages

- Makes your code more reliable and reusable

---

## Who should write an R package

- Everyone should!
    - Good for a reasonably large project where the code is expected to be developed and maintained over more than a few weeks
    - Even if your code involves an analysis only -- you can create an R package for the repeated tasks

- Especially true if you develop biostatistical methods or utility tools

---

## A barebone R package

- It is simple to make an R package

- An R package is not much more than a folder structure:
```
myPackage/
|--DESCRITION
|--NAMESPACE
|--R/
|--...other files...
```

- Create an R package where you would create a folder for a new project
    - But don't nest an R package within another

---

## General process to get started

1. Create a package skeleton using
  
  ```r
  usethis::create_package("path/to/package")
  ```

1. Move R code into `R/`

1. Edit `DESCRIPTION`

1. In an analysis file, issue `devtools::load_all(path/to/package)`. Your R functions will be ready to use


---

## Your turn

- Create a package skeleton using `usethis::create_package()`

- Put your code for comparing linear models (from HW1) in `R/`

&lt;!-- - Edit the DESCRIPTION file --&gt;

- In a separate `analysis.R` file outside of the package. 

    - Load your package using `devtools::load_all()` (supply the correct path)

    - Write some analysis code 

---

## A quick overview of components

Take the [`fdapace`](https://github.com/functionaldata/tPACE) as example, which implement methods for functional data analysis:

- `DESCRIPTION` describes basic metadata about the package, e.g., package name, title, description, authors/maintainer/contributors, license, dependencies, etc

- `NAMESPACE` specifies what functions your package makes available to users and what functions from other packages it depends on. Generated automatically by Roxygen2

- `R/` includes the `.R` files, mainly containing functions

- `tests/` contains all the unit test files

- `man/` contains the documentations. Generated automatically by Roxygen2

---

## More components...

- `data/` contains the data shipped with the package

- `vignettes/` contains the vignette files

- `inst/` for other files that will be installed with the package

- `src/` contains the sources files for the compiled code (e.g., C/C++)

---

## Loading and attaching a library

- We will be a little bit careful about what it means by *loading* and *attaching* a library in this lecture

- When you *load* a package, the functions, manuals, and dynamic libraries are loaded into memory
    - Functions can be found using `pkg::func`

- When you *attach* a package, you are attaching the package environment to your search path (recall [search path](09_environments.html#search-path))
    - After attaching, you can find a function by typing its name in the R concole

---

## DESCRIPTION: Specifying dependency

`Imports:`, `Suggests:`, and `Depends:` specify what packages does yours depend on, to different extents

- `Imports:` specifies packages being depended upon by your functions. These packages will be loaded but not attached when your package is attached. Most dependency should belong here

- `Depends:` specifies packages being depended upon by your functions. These packages will be loaded and attached when your package is attached. Only very few packages that ought to be used together with yours should be attached

- `Suggests:` specifies optional packages that enhances the use of yours. These packages do not need to be installed

---

## DESCRIPTION: Versions

- Version: Usually go by `major.minor.patch` (e.g., `4.2.1`)

- Development versions have a fourth component (e.g., `0.0.0.9001`)

- Your package can depends on a package with a certain version, e.g., `dplyr (&gt;= 1.0.0)`; or a certain R version, e.g., `R (&gt;= 3.5.0)`

---

## License

- Who writes the code usually holds the copyright

- The copyright holders can determine how others may use their code through *licenses*. These are legal documents

- Using a license helps others to use your code

- There are primarily two types of licenses for open source software

  - *Permissive licenses* impose minimal restrictions. Users can usually freely use, modify, and distribute the code provided they make available a copy of the license. E.g., MIT, Apaches, and various BSD licenses. Python is released under a permissive license

  - *Copyleft licenses* require the users not to take way the freedom of their downstream users. Software developed upon copyleft code cannot be close-sourced. E.g., GPL 2, GPL 3, and Creative Commons licenses. R is released under GPL

- Two licenses are said to be *compatible* if there is a legitimate way to bundle and redistribute the code (under a certain license)

---

## DESCRIPTION: License

- You must choose one of these [standard licenses](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db) if you want to release on CRAN

- Often come as the form `MIT + file LICENSE`. Specify the copyright year and holder in a file `LICENSE` next to `DESCRIPTION`

---

## DESCRIPTION: Other details

- `LinkingTo:` to specify the names of the header files your package depends on for compiling C/C++ code

- Other fields to specify detailed behaviors (`LazyData`, `VignetteBuilder`, etc)

- There are some detailed formatting requirements for the title/description fields etc. 

    - Refer to either a recently published CRAN package 
    - or the R manual for [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html)

---

## NAMESPACE

- The file `NAMESPACE` controls the 
    - imports, namely what packages or functions from other packages does your package need (`import()` and `importFrom()`). They go into the imports:pkg environment
    - exports, namely what functions, S3/S4 generic or methods do you make available to the users. They go into the package:pkg environment
    - all functions including unexported helper functions are found in the namespace:pkg environment

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/namespace.png)
]

---

## NAMESPACE

- `devtools::load_all()` makes available all functions from the package, while `library()` only makes available the exported ones

- We will generate `NAMESPACE` automatically (later)

- A bug bearer: If you defined an S3 method in a package but did not export it, you will not be able to dispatch it from the global environment, even if you used `devtools::load_all()`

- This is because for speed, S3 dispatch only looks for *registered* S3 methods and functions that look like an S3 method defined in the environment where the generic function is called (but not in the parent environments)

- Register an S3 method using `.S3method()` in an R script (not recommended) or export it in `NAMESPACE` using `S3method()`

---

## Documenting package

- Documentation make it possible for users to learn to use your code

- `man/` holds all the R documentations, but we are not going to edit it directly

- `library(roxygen2)` let us write documentation together with the code. It also generates the `NAMESPACE`

- `roxygen2` processes code files in `R/` and extract and process the documentation

- It uses conventions and tags to know how to format the documentation

---

- In your R code, start a line with `#'` to indicate this line is for `roxygen2` documentation

```
#' Compare two models (title)
#'
#' Compare two models according to what their `summary()` 
#' method prints out (description)
#'
#' More details: This is a very rudimentary implementation. 
#' The two models are compared according to the text output 
#' of `summary()` (details)
CompModels &lt;- function(mod1, mod2, ...) {

  ...
  diffviewer::visual_diff(f1, f2)
}
```

- Use `devtools::document()` to compile the documents and update the NAMESPACE, and then `devtools::load_all()` again. You will then be able to find `?CompModels`

---

## Useful roxygen tags

- `@export` marks a function, S3/S4 method, or S4 class to be exported
    - will register S3/S4 method

- `@param mod1 An lm model to be compared` 

- `@returns An object for text comparisons` (or `@return`)

- `@examples`

- Roxygen also understands markdown syntax

---

## Package description

- An [example](https://github.com/functionaldata/tPACE/blob/master/R/pkgname.R) from `fdapace` for describing the package itself. This page (after compiled and loaded) can be found using `?fdapace`

- Use import tags in this file to indicate dependencies

    - `@import AnEntirePackage`

    - `@importFrom Package selectedFunc1 selectedFunc2`

---

## Repeating documentation

- Repeating documentation is good for the users. This is sometimes inevitable because the APIs are highly similar

![:scale 40%](images/stringr1.png)
![:scale 40%](images/stringr2.png)
]

---

## But don't repeat yourself (DRY)

- `roxygen2` let you repeat documentation without repeating code

- `@inherit`, `@inheritParams`: Inherit documentation from another function. [See `str_replace`](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr/blob/HEAD/R/replace.r)

- `@rdname`, `@describeIn`: Describe a function within another documentation (combine documentation pages)

- `@name` to name the documentation

---

class: inverse

## Your turn

Create some documentation and manage imports/exports for the R package you created last time.

- Write Roxygen2 documentation for your function for comparing models. Make sure to include a title, description, parameter descriptions (`@param`), and an explaination for the return value (`@returns`)

- Run `devtools::document()` to compile the help page, and use `devtools::load_all()` to reload the package. Check out what does the help page look like using `?funcName`

- Now, export the function using `@export`. Also, import functions you used in your code using `@importFrom pkg func1 func2`. Run `devtools::document()` again and check out how NAMESPACE is changed

---

## Unit tests

- `tests/` is for unit tests

- The easist way to set up a testing system is to `usethis::use_testthat()`

- `devtools::test()` runs all the unit tests

- `tests/testthat.R` is a boilerplate code

- Test files should be included as `tests/testthat/test_RScriptName.R`

- Datasets/files only useful for testing can be included in `tests/testthat/fixture/`

- Continuous integration means new code are automatically tested and built. See [`use_github_action_check_standard()`](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html)

---

## Other files

- `data/` contains data useful by themselves or will be used in an example. See `usethis::use_data_raw()`

- `vignettes/` contains vignette files. Can be compiled from RMarkDown

- `inst/` for other files that will be installed with the package, e.g., dataset (potentially in non-R formats), non-R libraries, licenses, etc

- `NEWS.md` for describing updates

- `README.Rmd`, `README.md` for github

---

## Packaging and building

From [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/Structure.html#fig-installation)
]

---

## Checks

- `devtools::check()` performs various checks for the package

- In order to publish on CRAN, there is a total of 50 checks that must be passed

- `ERROR`s are severe problems. You must fix these in order for the package to work

- `WARNING`s are likely problems. They must be fixed before publishing on CRAN

- `NOTE`s are mild issues. You should try to eliminate all notes before submitting to CRAN

---

## Release to CRAN

If you reach this step, congrats! 

- Test and check one last time before submission
    - Your package should work cross-platform

- The rest are some routine forms for [submitting to CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html)

- `devtools::release()` makes this process easier

- Use `cran-comments.md` to communicate with the CRAN maintainers
