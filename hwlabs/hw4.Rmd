Your submission should include both code and well-formatted explanation (not just R comments) and is expected to be reproducible. You may decide for yourself what reproducible file format do you use. 
*Please post on Ed Discussion (accessible in bCourses) for technical questions.*

For this homework, submit the following files on bCourses:

- A report including your answers/discussion for the HW questions.

- A separate R script for the Shiny app in Question 2.


# Questions

1. Create a function to aggregate a data frame by group. The function should accept the following arguments: A data frame; a character scalar specifying the name of the column to be aggregated; a character scalar for the group by column; and a function specifying the aggregator function (could be `mean` or `median`, say). Make sure to include some unit tests for correctness. 

1. Write an R script including a Shiny app for visualizing the `gapminder::gapminder` dataset. The app will let the users visualize the one column grouped by another column. The user will select a column to visualize, and another column as the group by column (check out the examples in `?selectInput`). Your app should automatically choose an appropriate geom depending on the user inputs.

1. Look at [two pieces of caveats in visualization (summarized by Jan Holtz)](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html) that you did not previously know. Find appropriate dataset(s) and implement a bad and a good version for each caveat.
