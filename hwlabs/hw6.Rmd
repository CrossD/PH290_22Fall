# SQL

For the following questions, please use SQL queries to preprocess the data as much as possible (instead of R commands for data wrangling).

1. Produce a table of number of admissions by sex and diagnosis. Show only diagnosis-sex combination with at least 30 occurrences. Make sure the names for the diagnosis is informative (they cannot be just diagnosis codes). A patient may have multiple diagnoses after admission, but we will focus on only the primary diagnosis in this question. [Hint: You will need these tables: `d_icd_diagnoses`, `diagnoses_icd`, and `patients`]
